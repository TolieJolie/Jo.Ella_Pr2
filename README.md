### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learnt

I learnt how to build a responsive page using Flexbox and Media Query.
It was interesting and also brain-tasking.

```html
<script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/7608e9e822.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```
```css
@media screen and (max-width: 600px){
.container{
        flex-direction: column;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
        width: 100vw;
    }
}
```

### Continued development
Going forward, i will work more on honing my use of CSS and also building more responsive projects.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.google.com) - This helped me with building the project as i asked questions based on my little knowledge of HTML and CSS , i tell you today that google is your friend, use it, it works.
- [Resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com) - This is an amazing website which helped me understand a lot about CSS especially flexbox and media queries. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
